# Kalman-Filter

Extra credit project for "Artificial Intelligence" course at The College of New Jersey during the Spring 2020 semester. The program uses Kalman filtering, a common technique used for object tracking, to predict the actual water level of a water tank over time from noisy and inaccurate observations. 

Three scenarios are assessed, a water tank with a constant water level, a water tank that's filling with water at a constant rate, and a sloshing water tank where the water is sloshing back and forth in a sin wave function
